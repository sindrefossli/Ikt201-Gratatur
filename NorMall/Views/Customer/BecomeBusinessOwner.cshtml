<h2>Become a business owner</h2>
<h3 class="text-danger">If you become a business owner, 
    you will no longer be able to buy items using this account, 
    or view you order history! 
    The name must also be unique, 
    so if you are being sent back to this page when pressing the Become a business owner button, 
    it means the name is not unique.</h3>
